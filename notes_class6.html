<h3 id="probability-distribution">Probability Distribution:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>List of probabilities associated with each of it’s possible outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for discrete random variables, the probability distribution is called “probability mass function” or “probability density function”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assigning-probabilities-in-discrete-cases">Assigning Probabilities in discrete cases:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Number of points in  S is finite or countably infinite</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>p(s) = probability function</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Random variable X may take k different values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The probability that \(X = x_i\) is defined as \(P(X=x_i) = P_i\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The probabilities, \(P_i\), must satisfy the following:</p>
  </li>
  <li>\(0 \leq P_i \leq 1\) for each i</li>
  <li>\(p_1 + p_2 + … + P_k = 1\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cumulative-distribution-function-cdf">Cumulative Distribution function: (cdf)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A function giving the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to k, i.e. sum up all of the probabilities for \(x \leq k\)</li>
