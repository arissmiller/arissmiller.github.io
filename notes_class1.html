<h2 id="definitions">Definitions:</h2>

<h3 id="experiment">Experiment:</h3>
<p>any procedure that can be repeated an infinite number of times and that has a well defined set of possible outcomes(e.g. rolling a die, taking a measurement or reading)</p>

<h3 id="sample-outcome">Sample Outcome:</h3>

<p>each of the potential outcomes of an experiment</p>

<h3 id="sample-space">Sample Space:</h3>

<p>total number and kind of possible outcomes e.g. coin -&gt; 1-6, die -&gt; H/T</p>

<h3 id="event">Event:</h3>

<p>a designated collection of sample outcomes, The entire sample space and null set.
  an event has occurred if the outcome of the experiment is one of the members of the event</p>

<h3 id="simple-event">Simple Event:</h3>

<p>an event with only one outcome
  e.g. rolling a die once and getting a 6</p>

<h3 id="compound-event">Compound Event:</h3>

<p>event that consists of multiple events
  e.g. getting an odd number when a die is rolled</p>

<h3 id="intersection-of-events-a-and-b">Intersection of events A and B:</h3>

<p>Outcomes common to both A and B, written as \(A \cap B\)</p>

<h3 id="union-of-events-a-and-b">Union of events A and B:</h3>

<p>All outcomes in events A and B (no repeats), written as \(A \cup B\)</p>

<h3 id="compelement-of-event-a">Compelement of event A:</h3>

<p>Set of outcomes not included in the outcomes of the event, written as \(A^c\)</p>

<h3 id="mutually-exclusive">Mutually Exclusive:</h3>

<p>No outcomes in common, i.e. \(A \cap B = \emptyset\)</p>
