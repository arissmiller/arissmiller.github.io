<h3 id="conditional-probability">Conditional Probability:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The probability of an event A may have to be adjusted if we know that some related event B has already occurred.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dpendent-events">Dpendent Events:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When the outcome or occurrence affects the outcome or occurrence of the second event in such a way that the probability has changed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Drawing a card from a deck without replacing it then drwing a second card</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> selecting a ball from a bucket, not replacing it, then selecting a second ball</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="multiplication-rule-for-dependent-events-conditional-probability">Multiplication rule for dependent events (Conditional Probability)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When 2 events, A and B, are dependent, the probability of both occurring is \(P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(P(B \mid A)\) is read as Probability of B given A</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(P(A \mid B \) is read as Probability of A given B</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conditional-probability-1">Conditional Probability:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Any Probability that is revised to take into account the known occurrence of other events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effect of additional information is to revise (possibly to shrink) the sample space \(S \to S’\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conditonal-probability-formula">Conditonal Probability Formula:</h3>

<p>\(P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\)
  also:
  \(P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}\)</p>

<h3 id="probabilites-for-at-least-questions-see-ex9-and-10">Probabilites for “at least” questions (see ex.9 and 10)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Multiplication rules for complementary events</li>
  <li>sometimes it is easier tofind compement than to calculate all possibilities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calculating-unconditional-and-inverse-probabilities">Calculating unconditional and inverse probabilities:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Partitioned sample space, (broken up into n mutually exclusive events)</li>
  <li>Sample space is union of n independent events, since there is no overlap we do not have to subtract intersections \(S = \bigcup \limits_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\)</li>
  <li>No intersection between individual events, written as \(A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset\)</li>
  <li>\(i \neq j\)</li>
  <li>\(P(Ai \gt 0)\)</li>
  <li>The probability for an event is the sum of all conditional probabilities, so</li>
  <li>\(P(B) = \sum^{n}_{i = 1} P(B \mid A_i) \cdot P(A_i)\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bayes-theorem">Baye’s Theorem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Extension of conditional probability</li>
  <li>Inverse Probbility: If we know \(P(B \mid A_i)\) for all \(A_i\), then we can find \(P(A_i \mid B)\)</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(P(A_j \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A_j) \cdot P(A_j)}{\sum^{n}_{i =1} P(B\mid A_i) \cdot P(A_i)}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The above means the conditional probability of this event, divided by the sum of all probabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>Questions to ask
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Is the problem asking for an unconditinoal probability (partitioned sample space where \(\sum P(B \mid A_i)\)) or a conditional probability (Baye’s thm)?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If unconditional, let B denote the ecent whose probability you are looking for</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If conditional, let B denote the event that has already happened</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once B is identified, go back and assign all the \(A_i\)’s</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
