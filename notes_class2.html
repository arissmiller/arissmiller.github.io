<h3 id="probability-function">Probability function:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>\(P(E) = n(E)/n(S)\)</li>
  <li>Probability of any event e is a number between and including 0 and 1</li>
  <li>The sum of all probabilities in the sample space is 1</li>
  <li>If an event cannot occur its probability is 0</li>
  <li>if an event is certain, the probability is 1</li>
  <li>probability function is a mapping from an event to a number</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="complementary-events">Complementary events:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mutually-exclusive-events">Mutually Exclusive Events:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>if A and B are mutually exclusive, \(P(A \cup B)  = P(A) + P(B)\)</li>
  <li>if S has an infinite number events, and all are mutually exclusive,
then the probability of the union of all events is the sum of all their
individual probabilities</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-general">In General:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Probability of the null set is 0 (probability of no outcome is 0)</li>
  <li>if A is a subset of B, then  \( P(A) \leq P(B)\)</li>
  <li>\(P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="three-events-that-are-not-mutually-exclusive">Three events that are not mutually exclusive:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>\(P(A \cup  B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P (B \cap C) + P (A \cap B \cap C) \)</li>
</ul>

<p>\(P(9 \cup D) = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{51} \approx 0.30\)</p>
