<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<h3 id="independence">Independence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two events A and B are independent if the fact that A occurs does not efffect the probability of B occurring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ex. roll a die and get a “6”, roll a second die and get a “3”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If A and B are independent, then \(P(A \cup B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If A and B are independent, then \(P(A \mid B) = P(A)\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="independence-and-complements">Independence and complements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If A and B are independent, then \(A^c\) and \(B^c\) are independent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(P(A^c \cup B^c) = P(A \cap B)^c\)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mutual-exclusion-does-not-imply-independence">Mutual Exclusion does not imply independence</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If A and B are mutually exclusive, then the \(P(A \cap B) = 0\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since \(P(A) \cdot P(B) &gt; 0\) the equality in definition of independence is not satisfied</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="independence-of-more-than-two-events-mutually-independent-events">Independence of more than two events (Mutually Independent Events)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Events \(A_1, A_2, A_3, … A_n\) are independent if
\(P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3 … \cap A_n) = P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2) \cdot P(A_3) … \cdot P(A_n)\)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="multiplication-rule">Multiplication rule:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If operation A can be done in M different ways, and operation B can be done in n different ways, then the sequence (op A, op B) can be done in m * n different ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“and” means to multiply, in a sequence of possibilities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ways to sum to 10: \({(4,6), (5,5), (6,4)}\)</p>

<p>Ways to sum to 7: \({(6,1), (5,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5), (1,6)}\)</p>

<p>Since all sequences are mutually exclusive, probability of winning a point 10 is the sum of the infitine number of products</p>

<p>\(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{3}{36} \cdot \frac{3}{36} \cdot (\frac{27}{36})^k\)</p>

<p>This is a convergent geometic series</p>

<p>\(\frac{3}{36} \cdot \frac{3}{36} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\frac{27}{36}} = \frac{1}{36}\)</p>

<p>Do this math for all possible points. Player wins by rolinga sum of 7 or 11 on first roll, or by getting 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 on first roll and making a point.</p>

<p>Probability that the player wins is the sum of all possibilities (Probability of 7 or 11 on first, and probability of each point).</p>
