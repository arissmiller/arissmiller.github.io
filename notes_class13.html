<h3 id="normal-distributions">Normal Distributions:</h3>
<p>The continuous random variable X follows a Normal Distribution if its pdf is:</p>

<p>\(f_x(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}\)</p>

<p>mean = \(\mu\)
variance = \(\sigma^2\)
\(x~N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</p>

<p>Charateristics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bell shaped peak = maxium = \(x=\mu)\), Inflection peaks at \(x = \mu \pm \sigma\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All normal curves are symmetric about \(\mu\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Area under normal curve = 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(f(x) \approx N(\mu, \sigma^2) \gt 0\) (All probabilities are positive)\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lim{x\to\infty} f(x) = 0 \lim{x\to -\infty} = 0\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The are under normal curve that lies within one standard deviation is ~0.68, about 68% of the total area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 Standard deviations of mean ~ 0.95 (95%), 3 standard deviations ~ .997 (99.7%)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“Standard Normal”: \(\mu = 0\),\(\sigma = 1\) ~N(0,1)</p>

<h3 id="z-value">Z value:</h3>

<p>A number of standard deviations that a particular X is away from the mean</p>

<p>\(z  = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma}\)</p>

<p>Are under a standard normal curve = probability</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>to the left of any z value: use table</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To the right of any z value: subtract area to the left from 1</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between 2 z values: subtract are to left of left z from right z</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="continuity-correction">Continuity Correction:</h3>

<p>When we have a normal approximation to a Binomial distribution</p>

<p>n is large, but experiment is binomial.</p>

<p>appropriate when \(np \geq 5\) \(nq \geq 5\)</p>

<p>for \(P(X=a)\) use \(  P(a - 0.5 \lt x \lt a + 0.5)\)</p>

<p>for \(P(X\geq a)\)  use \( P(x \geq a - 0.5)\)</p>

<p>for \(P(X \gt a)\) use \(P(X \gt a + 0.5)\)</p>

<p>for \(P(X \leq a)\) use \(P(X \lt a + 0.5)\)</p>

<p>for \(P(X \lt a)\) use \(P(X \lt a - 0.5)\)</p>

<p>for binomial probabilities: \(\mu = np\) and \(\sigma = \sqrt{npq}\)</p>

<h3 id="central-limit-theorem">Central limit theorem</h3>

<p>How do the means of samples of the sames size taken from the same population vary about the population mean?</p>

<p>Sampling distribution(of sample means) is a distribution obtained by using the means computed from random samples of a specific size taken from the population</p>

<p>Sampling error: Is the difference between the sample measure and corresponding population measure (i.e. sample is not a perfect representation of the population \(E(\bar{x}) = \mu_{\bar{x}} = \mu\)</p>

<p>Mean of the sample means will be the same as population mean</p>

<p>Standard deviation of sample means will be smaller than the standard dev of population \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)</p>

<p>variance = \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \sigma_{\bar{x}}^2\)</p>

<p>\(z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\)</p>

<p>When \(n \geq 30\) you have a large enough sample size that distribution is normal, unless otherwise stated.
