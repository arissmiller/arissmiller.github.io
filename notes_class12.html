<h3 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson distribution:</h3>

<p>probability mass function that models real world phenomena</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>number of typos on printed page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>number of cars passing though an intersection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alaskan salmon caught in a net</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cutomsers at an ATM in 10 min intervals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>number of alpha particles emitted by a radioactive source in a given time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>X = descrete ranom variable that denotes the # of times a given event occurs within an interval of time or space</p>

<h3 id="poisson-limit">Poisson Limit:</h3>

<p>Used to approximate hard to calculate binoomial probabilities where values of n and p reflect conditions of limit</p>

<p>\(n\to \infty\)  \(p \to 0\) but \(n \cdot p\) is constant</p>

<p>Remember: \(n \cdot p = E(x)\) for Binomial random variables, and \(n \cdot p \cdot q = Var(x)\)</p>

<h3 id="deriving-poisson-from-binomial-distribution">Deriving Poisson from Binomial distribution:</h3>

<p>X = Binomial Random Variable</p>

<p>\(P(X=k)  = P_x(k) = (n \choose k) p^k(1-p)^{n-k} k = 0,1,2â€¦n\)</p>

<p>Poisson Distribution = \(\frac{e^{-np}(np)^k}{k!} = P(X=k)\)</p>

<ol>
  <li>no explicit Binomrial variable is present</li>
  <li>Values for na and p are unavailable</li>
</ol>

<p>X (disccrete random variable is said to have a poisson distr. if:</p>

<p>\(P_x(k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^k}{k!}\)</p>

<h3 id="modeling-a-series-of-events-within-a-given-time-interval-t">Modeling a series of events within a given time interval T</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Probability &gt;= 2 events occur within a given subinterval isgoes to 0</li>
  <li>The events occur indepentently (binomial))</li>
  <li>The probability that an event occurs duringa given subinteral is constant over the entire interval from[0 to T]</li>
  <li>Each sub interval is like an independent tryial in abinomial model</li>
</ol>

<p>X = discrete ranom variable for tot al # of vents occuring within T</p>

<p>\(\lambda =\) the rate at which  the events are occurring</p>

<p>\(E(X) = \lambda \cdot T = n \cdot p\)</p>

<p>\(P_n =\) probability that an event occurs within a given subinterval = \(\frac{\lambda T}{n}\)</p>

<p>\(\therefore P_x(k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda T}(\lambda T)^k}{k!}\)</p>

<h3 id="the-interval-between-consecutively-ocurring-events-can-be-modeled-with-poisson">The interval between consecutively ocurring events can be modeled with Poisson</h3>
<p>x = # of ocurrences</p>

<p>y = interval between occurrences</p>

<p>Series of events is a poisson model, where \(\lambda\) = rate at which events are occuring</p>

<p>y = random vairable for interval between consecutive events</p>

<p>\(f_y(y) = \lambda e^{-\lambda y} y \gt 0\)</p>

<p>Use pmf for poisson:  \(\frac{e^{-np}(np)^k}{k!} = P(X=k)\)</p>

<p>at least one = 1 - P(X=0))</p>

<p>\(P(X \geq 1)) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \frac{e^{-3}3^0}{0!} = 1 - e^{-3} \approx 0.9502\)</p>

<h4 id="b-what-is-the-probability-that-randomly-selected-age-will-have-at-most-one-typo">b: What is the probability that randomly selected age will have AT MOST one typo?</h4>

<p>at most one: \(P(X \leq 1) = P(X=1) + P(X=0)\)</p>

<p>\(= \frac{e^{-3}3^1}{1!} + \frac{e^{-3}3^0}{0!} = 4e^3 \approx 00.1992\)</p>

Assuming the worst contamination level, at the FDA limit of 30 insect parts/100grams (0.3 fragments per gram). what is the proability that a 20 gram sandwich will hae more than 5 bug parts?</h3>

<p>In 20 grams of pb, we get (20g)(0.3f) = 6.0 fragments. This means that the mean E(X) = 6.0 = \(\lambda\)</p>

<p>What is the probability that  there are 5 or more bug parts?</p>

<p>\(P(X \geq 5) = 1 - P(X \leq 4) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^4\frac{3^{-6}6^k}{k!} = 1 - 0.29 = 0.71\)</p>

<p>71 % chance of getting 5 or more bug parts in a sandwich</p>

Y is the random variable for the interval between consecutive sightings (in minutes). What is the probability that and ovserver who has just seen a meteor will have to wait &gt;= 5 minutes before seeing another?</h3>

<p>\(\lambda e^{-\lambda y}\)</p>

<p>40/hr =  0.67 sightings per minute = \(\lambda\)</p>

<p>\(P(X \geq 5) = \int_5^\infty 0.67e^{-0.67y}dy = \displaystyle{\lim_{b\to\infty}}\int_5^b0.67e^{-0.67y}dy \approx 0.035\)</p>
